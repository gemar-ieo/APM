# Summary

Pockmarks are concave crater-like depressions on the seafloor generated by the focused expulsion of fluids—primarily methane gas or pore water—through the sediment-water interface [@Judd:2007]. These geophysical structures are critical indicators of subsurface fluid flow systems, influencing seafloor stability, the global oceanic carbon cycle, and the distribution of specialized benthic habitats.

The **Automatic Pockmarks Mapping (APM)** tool is a semi-automated toolbox developed within the ESRI ArcGIS environment (ArcMap). It enables the systematic processing of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) derived from multibeam echosounder bathymetry for the detection and morphometric characterization of these depressions. APM standardizes the extraction of geometric parameters, mitigating the interpretative bias inherent in manual mapping and allowing for the rigorous statistical analysis of large bathymetric datasets.

# Statement of need

The research purpose of APM is to provide a standardized, objective, and efficient methodology for pockmark characterization. Manual identification of pockmarks is not only time-consuming but also highly subjective; different experts may delineate the same pockmark with significantly different boundaries, leading to inconsistent datasets.

In the context of marine geology, there is a growing need to process massive amounts of multibeam bathymetry data collected by research vessels. APM solves the problem of "manual bottleneck" by automating the detection and geomorphometric analysis. The target audience includes marine geomorphologists, GIS technicians in environmental agencies, and students of marine sciences who require a tool that integrates directly with standard commercial GIS software like ESRI ArcGIS without needing advanced programming skills.

# State of the field

Existing tools for pockmark mapping generally fall into two categories:
1. **Script-based tools**: Methods using R or MATLAB [@Andrews:2010] offer high customization but require the user to be proficient in coding and often lack a visual interface for immediate spatial validation.
2. **GIS-specific toolboxes**: Previous work like the semi-automated method by @Gafeira:2012 and @Gafeira:2018 established excellent foundations. 

**Why APM? (Build vs. Contribute)**:
While @Gafeira:2012 provided a path-breaking approach, APM was built to overcome specific limitations observed in previous ArcGIS-based tools. Firstly, APM introduces a unique logic for locating the "low point" of a pockmark on sloping seafloors, avoiding the common error of selecting a point on the rim rather than the true center of the depression. Secondly, APM uses the **Irregularity Index** [@Grosse:2009] as a core filtering parameter, which is more robust than simple circularity filters for natural seabed features. Finally, APM is designed as an "all-in-one" ArcGIS toolbox that requires zero external dependencies, making it more accessible for institutional users with restricted software environments.

# Software design

APM was designed following a modular architecture using ArcGIS Model Builder. This choice reflects a trade-off between the absolute performance of raw code (like Python/C++) and the **usability/transparency** required by the target research community. By using Model Builder, the workflow is visual and "open," allowing researchers to inspect every geoprocessing step, which is crucial for scientific reproducibility.

The design centers on three key components:
- **Optimization Stage**: Uses focal statistics to handle sensor noise, ensuring that the subsequent Bathymetric Position Index (BPI) calculation does not generate false positives from data artifacts.
- **Feature Delineation**: Leverages BPI [@Lundblad:2006] to define pockmark rims. The design choice here was to allow a "Selective Manual Cleaning" phase. This reflects a design philosophy of "Human-in-the-loop" AI, acknowledging that geological expertise is still necessary to distinguish pockmarks from other depressions like ship-wreck scours or dredging marks.
- **Geomorphometric Engine**: Automatically extracts 12+ parameters. A significant design implementation is the automated azimuth calculation, which uses the "Longest Axis" method to determine pockmark orientation, vital for interpreting bottom currents [@Picard:2018].

# Research impact statement

The APM tool has demonstrated its utility through its application in the **EsMarEs** project (Marine Strategies in Spain), specifically within action C12A2. It has been used to characterize pockmark fields across four diverse test geological regions: the Guadiaro Deep Fan, Capbreton Canyon, Murcia Slope, and Mallorca Channel. 

Beyond institutional projects, the tool has also proven its value in academic research and higher education. A notable example is its use in the Master's thesis by @SuaEscobar:2025 at the University of Cádiz, where APM was employed to perform a geomorphometric characterization of pockmarks on the Murcia continental margin. 

The software enables the generation of standardized geomorphological information layers (shapefiles and density maps) that support marine spatial planning and the management of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). Benchmarks conducted during these projects showed that APM can reduce the time required for geomorphometric characterization by up to 80% compared to manual methods. By providing a reproducible and objective workflow, APM serves as a bridge between raw bathymetric data and the high-level analysis required by national environmental strategies and academic research.

# AI usage disclosure

No generative AI tools were used in the development of the APM software code. This manuscript was prepared by the authors with the assistance of an AI language model for structural optimization to meet JOSS requirements; however, all scientific content, geomorphological interpretations, and data were provided and verified by the human authors.
