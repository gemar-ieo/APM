# Summary

Pockmarks are concave crater-like depressions on the seafloor generated by the focused expulsion of fluids—primarily methane gas or pore water—through the sediment-water interface [@Judd:2007]. These geophysical structures are critical indicators of subsurface fluid flow systems, influencing seafloor stability, the global oceanic carbon cycle, and the distribution of specialized benthic habitats.

The **Automatic Pockmarks Mapping (APM)** tool is a semi-automated toolbox developed within the ESRI ArcGIS environment (ArcMap). It enables the systematic processing of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) derived from multibeam echosounder bathymetry for the detection and morphometric characterization of these depressions. APM standardizes the extraction of geometric parameters, mitigating interpretative bias inherent in manual mapping and allowing for rigorous statistical analysis of large bathymetric datasets. The software is intended for a broad audience, including marine geomorphologists, environmental GIS technicians, and students of marine sciences, who may not have extensive programming experience.

# Statement of need

The research purpose of APM is to provide a standardized, objective, and efficient methodology for pockmark characterization. Manual identification of pockmarks is time-consuming and highly subjective, often resulting in inconsistent datasets due to varying interpretations among experts.

APM addresses the growing demand in marine geology for processing massive multibeam bathymetry datasets collected by research vessels. By automating pockmark detection and geomorphometric analysis, APM reduces the "manual bottleneck." The target audience includes researchers and practitioners needing an easy-to-use tool integrated with commercial GIS platforms without requiring advanced programming skills [@Andrews:2010].

# State of the field

Existing tools for pockmark mapping generally fall into two categories:

1. **Script-based tools**: Tools implemented in R or MATLAB [@Andrews:2010] offer flexibility and customization but require coding proficiency and typically lack visual interfaces for immediate spatial validation.
2. **GIS-specific toolboxes**: Semi-automated approaches in ArcGIS, such as @Gafeira:2012 and @Gafeira:2018, provide visual workflows but have limitations in accuracy, center point detection, and accessibility for users without external dependencies.

**Why APM?**  
APM improves upon previous ArcGIS-based tools by introducing a robust method for locating the true center of pockmarks on sloping seafloors, using the **Irregularity Index** [@Grosse:2009] for more accurate filtering of natural seabed features. It integrates all functionalities into a single toolbox, requiring zero external dependencies, thus increasing accessibility for institutional users with limited software flexibility.

# Software design

APM employs a modular design using ArcGIS Model Builder, balancing **performance** with **usability and transparency**. The visual workflow allows researchers to inspect every processing step, which is crucial for reproducibility in scientific studies.

Key components include:

- **Optimization Stage**: Applies focal statistics to reduce noise in DEMs, ensuring Bathymetric Position Index (BPI) calculations do not produce false positives.  
- **Feature Delineation**: Uses BPI [@Lundblad:2006] to define pockmark rims, with a selective manual cleaning step to allow human expertise in distinguishing pockmarks from artifacts.  
- **Geomorphometric Engine**: Automatically extracts >12 parameters, including orientation via the "Longest Axis" method, which is critical for interpreting seabed currents [@Picard:2018].

# Research impact statement

APM has been applied in the **EsMarEs** project (Marine Strategies in Spain, action C12A2), covering diverse test areas: Guadiaro Deep Fan, Capbreton Canyon, Murcia Slope, and Mallorca Channel. 

It has been successfully employed in academic research, including the Master’s thesis by @SuaEscobar:2025, generating standardized geomorphological layers (shapefiles and density maps) for marine spatial planning. Benchmarks show APM can reduce analysis time by up to 80% relative to manual workflows. By providing reproducible workflows, APM bridges raw bathymetric data and high-level analyses necessary for environmental strategy and scientific research.

# AI usage disclosure

No generative AI tools were used in the development of APM software. This manuscript was edited for structure and clarity with AI assistance, but all scientific content, geomorphological interpretations, and data were provided and verified by the authors.
